modify openssl.cnf

location: > openssl version -d

First, modify the req parameters.
Add an alternate_names section to openssl.cnf with the names you want to use. 
There are no existing alternate_names sections, so it does not matter where you add it.

Also include CN in the alternative_names

[ alternate_names ]

DNS.1        = example.com
DNS.2        = www.example.com
DNS.3        = mail.example.com
DNS.4        = ftp.example.com

Next, add the following to the existing [ v3_ca ] section. Search for the exact string [ v3_ca ]:

subjectAltName      = @alternate_names

You might change keyUsage to the following under [ v3_ca ]:

keyUsage = digitalSignature, keyEncipherment

digitalSignature and keyEncipherment are standard faire for a server certificate. Don't worry about  nonRepudiation. Its a useless bit thought up by comp sci guys who wanted to be lawyers. It means nothing in the legal world.

In the end, the IETF (RFC 5280), Browsers and CAs run fast and loose, so it probably does not matter what key usage you provide.

Second, modify the signing parameters. Find this line under the CA_default section:

# Extension copying option: use with caution.
# copy_extensions = copy
And change it to:

# Extension copying option: use with caution.
copy_extensions = copy
This ensures the SANs are copied into the certificate. The other ways to copy the dns names are broken.
